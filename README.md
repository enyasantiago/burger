  # Burger
  ## Description 
  This burger logger application allows the user to add burger names to a list. The user has the ability tp move a burger to a list of devoured burgers, update devoured burgers to be shown back on the list of burgers that are available to eat and to delete a burger from the database entirely.
  In this assignment, I created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. The MVC design pattern was utilized. Node and MySQL were used to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars was used to generate your HTML.
